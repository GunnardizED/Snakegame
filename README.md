Snake Game

This is a Python script that implements a simple Snake game using the Turtle graphics library. The objective of the game is to control a snake and eat food to grow longer. The snake must avoid colliding with the boundaries of the game window or itself.

Prerequisites

    Python 3.x
    Turtle library

Installation

    Make sure you have Python 3.x installed on your system.
    The Turtle library is a built-in library in Python, so no additional installation is required.

Usage

    Save the script to a file with a .py extension (e.g., snake_game.py).
    Run the script using the following command:

    python snake_game.py

    The game window will appear, and the snake will start moving.
    Use the following keys to control the snake:
        Up arrow: Move the snake upwards
        Down arrow: Move the snake downwards
        Left arrow: Move the snake to the left
        Right arrow: Move the snake to the right
    The snake must eat the food to grow longer.
    The game ends if the snake collides with the boundaries of the game window or with itself.
    You can restart the game by running the script again.

Customization

You can customize the game by modifying the following constants at the beginning of the script:

    STARTING_POSITIONS: The initial positions of the snake segments.
    MOVE_DISTANCE: The distance the snake moves in each step.
    UP, DOWN, LEFT, RIGHT: The key codes for controlling the snake's direction.

You can also modify the appearance of the snake and the game window by modifying the corresponding code in the Snake class.
